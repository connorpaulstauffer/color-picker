## Exercise

Build a simple color picker. The picker should:

1. Take input for RGB values
2. Take input for transparency
3. Display the current color

Feel free to look up syntax while working. Just don't copy any code verbatim. Try to come up with your own UI.

Please take 1 hour to complete the exercise. If you finish early, take your pick of refactoring the React code, polishing styles, or improving UX.
