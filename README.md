## Exercise

Build a simple color picker. The picker should:

1. Take input for RGB values
2. Take input for transparency
3. Display the current color

You may look up syntax during the exercise but it is preferable
that you ask the interviewer.

You'll have 45 minutes to complete the exercise. If you finish early,
take your pick of refactoring the React code, polishing styles, or
improving UX.
